# Plot_Repo_JW

This repository copntains R codes to make different kinds of plots. Most of the codes were written by Jing W., while some of the codes were modified based on the codes created by someone else. The purpose of creating this repo is to gather, sort, and share codes used to generate various plots. 

The input data used to generate the plots are not available as some of them are sensitive data or unpublished data; therefore the R code is provided only to give a detailed record of how the plots were constructed through R programing, and without the data file that code cannot be run to recreate any plots.

## Overview

**Program** and **plot** folders contains R scripts and the output plots, respectively. R script and the corresponding plot file shared the same name. 

## Update

This GitHub repository will keep being updated. Hopefully!!
